# 🔧 Netlify 404 Error - Complete Fix

## ✅ Root Cause Identified

The issue was that Next.js was being deployed in **server mode** (`.next` directory) on Netlify, which doesn't work for static sites. We've fixed this by switching to **static export mode**.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Updated `next.config.js`
```javascript
output: "export" // Enables static export
images: {
  unoptimized: true // Required for static export
}
```

### 2. ✅ Updated `netlify.toml`
```toml
publish = "out"  # Changed from ".next" to "out"
# Simplified SPA fallback redirect
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 3. ✅ Added `_document.js`
Proper Next.js document structure for static export

### 4. ✅ Updated `.gitignore`
Added `out/` directory for build output

## 📋 What This Means

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Server-side rendering (SSR) | Static HTML export |
| `.next/` directory | `out/` directory |
| Requires Node.js server | Pure static files |
| Complex Netlify setup | Simple static hosting |
| 404 errors ❌ | All routes work ✅ |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes
```bash
cd c:\Users\chira\Rescue-Radar
git add .
git commit -m "fix: switch to static export for Netlify"
git push
```

### Step 2: Update Netlify Site Settings

**Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Select your site
2. Go to **Site Settings → Build & Deploy**
3. Update:
   - **Base directory:** `frontend`
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `out` (NOT `.next`!)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Trigger New Deploy
1. Go to **Deploys**
2. Click **"Clear cache and redeploy"**
3. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

## ✅ Verification

After redeployment:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] `/report` page loads
- [ ] `/reports-map` page loads  
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] No 404 errors
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) - no errors
- [ ] Check Netlify deploy logs - no errors

---

## 🔍 Testing the Fix Locally

Test the static export locally:

```bash
cd frontend

# Build static export
npm run build

# The 'out' directory will be created
# Test it locally with a simple server
npx http-server out -p 8080

# Visit http://localhost:8080 - should work!
```

---

## 🆘 If Still Getting 404

### Check 1: Verify Build Output
```bash
ls frontend/out/
# Should show: index.html, report, reports-map, _next, etc.
```

### Check 2: Check Netlify Logs
1. Netlify Dashboard → Deploys → Your Latest Deploy
2. Click "Deploy log" - look for errors
3. If build failed, check what went wrong

### Check 3: Check netlify.toml
Verify these exact settings:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "out"  # <-- Must be "out" not ".next"
```

### Check 4: Clear Everything
1. Delete `.next` and `out` folders locally
2. Run `npm run build` again
3. Verify `out/` directory created
4. Push to GitHub
5. Redeploy on Netlify

## 📊 File Structure After Build

```
frontend/
├── out/                    # BUILD OUTPUT
│   ├── index.html         # Homepage
│   ├── report/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── reports-map/
│   │   └── index.html
